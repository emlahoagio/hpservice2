            <p class="paragraph">Since 2016, theprintinghubs has become a well-renowned Printer &amp; Computer Selling
                Company in USA. What started out as a hobby turned into a full-fledged business offering the highest
                quality products at affordable prices. Our passion for fixing what’s broken has brought us to the
                forefront of the industry, and our impeccable results have kept us there.<br /><br /><strong>Additional
                    Features<br />‍</strong>Printers do more than just print. All-in-One devices can also copy, scan,
                and even send faxes (yes, some people do still use them!). You can expect to pay a bit more for
                All-in-One printers, but for many people, the extra capabilities are worth the additional expense. Also,
                keep an eye open for manufacturer-specific added features such as special photo printing modes and web
                apps.</p>
